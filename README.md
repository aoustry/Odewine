Optimal Deployment of Wireless Networks

GitHub repository accompanying the paper A. Oustry, M. Le Tilly, T. Clausen, C. D'Ambrosio, L. Liberti, "Optimal deployment of indoor wireless local area networks", Submitted.

## Requirements and installation
The following softwares are required to execute the code
- Python3
- G++ compiler
- The CPLEX API for C++

To generate one of the 3 executables, modify the makefile to compile:
- main_milp.cpp for the MILP algorithm,
- main_greedy.cpp for the greedy heuristics,
- main_heur_inf.cpp for the relaxation-based heuristics.

## Data

The instances files (.dat files located in the folder optim_instances/) used in the aforementioned article are generated by the command

```
python3 OptimInstanceBuilder.py
```

This files .dat are built from on radiowave propagation data (located in MAPLib/) generated by the following simulator: https://github.com/aoustry/FDFDRadiowaveSimulator. Indeed, the data in the folder MAPLib/ is cloned from the folder https://github.com/aoustry/FDFDRadiowaveSimulator/output.

## Numerical experiments

To run the numerical experiments that are presented in the aforementioned article, execute the following commands with frequency_number = 3 or 6:

```
./main_milp list_full.txt [frequency_number]
```
and
```
./main_greedy test.txt [frequency_number] 
```
and
```
./main_heur_inf test.txt [frequency_number] 40
```
